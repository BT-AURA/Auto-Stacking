# Conservative Staking Strategy
# Focuses on established validators with high trust scores

name: conservative
description: "Conservative strategy focusing on high-trust validators"

# Scoring weights (higher = more important)
weights:
  emission: 0.3      # Lower weight on emissions (less risky)
  trust: 1.5         # Higher weight on trust (safety first)
  validator_bonus: 0.5  # Bonus for validators

# Filters to exclude neurons
filters:
  min_stake: 100.0      # Minimum existing stake to consider
  max_stake: 10000.0    # Maximum stake to avoid concentration
  exclude_immune: false  # Include immune neurons
  exclude_duplicate_ip: true  # Exclude duplicate IPs
  min_trust: 0.1        # Minimum trust score
  min_emission: 0.0     # Minimum emission

# Allocation settings
max_targets: 5          # Maximum number of targets to stake
min_stake_per_target: 10.0   # Minimum TAO per target
max_stake_per_target: 500.0  # Maximum TAO per target
allocation_method: equal  # equal, proportional, or top_n
top_n_count: 3          # If allocation_method is top_n

# Rebalancing
rebalance_threshold: 0.15  # Rebalance if allocation drifts >15%
rebalance_interval_blocks: 2000  # Minimum blocks between rebalances

# APY and Risk Preferences
min_apy_7d: 5.0          # Minimum 7-day APY (%) to consider
min_apy_30d: 4.0         # Minimum 30-day APY (%) to consider
max_risk_score: 0.5      # Maximum risk score (0-1) to accept
exclude_risk_flags:      # Risk flags that exclude a neuron
  - very_low_validator_count
  - very_low_trust

# Safety
max_total_stake_ratio: 0.8  # Never stake more than 80% of balance
require_confirmation: true  # Require user confirmation for each stake
