# Aggressive Staking Strategy
# Maximizes returns by focusing on high-emission neurons

name: aggressive
description: "Aggressive strategy maximizing emission-based returns"

# Scoring weights (higher = more important)
weights:
  emission: 2.0         # High weight on emissions (maximize returns)
  trust: 0.5            # Lower weight on trust (more risk tolerance)
  validator_bonus: 0.2  # Small bonus for validators

# Filters to exclude neurons
filters:
  min_stake: 10.0       # Lower minimum stake threshold
  max_stake: 50000.0    # Higher max stake (more concentration allowed)
  exclude_immune: false # Include immune neurons (early opportunities)
  exclude_duplicate_ip: false  # Allow duplicate IPs
  min_trust: 0.05       # Lower minimum trust
  min_emission: 0.001   # Minimum emission threshold

# Allocation settings
max_targets: 10         # More targets for diversification
min_stake_per_target: 5.0    # Lower minimum per target
max_stake_per_target: 2000.0 # Higher maximum per target
allocation_method: proportional  # Proportional to scores
top_n_count: 5          # If allocation_method is top_n

# Rebalancing
rebalance_threshold: 0.20  # Rebalance if allocation drifts >20%
rebalance_interval_blocks: 1000  # More frequent rebalancing

# APY and Risk Preferences
min_apy_7d: 10.0         # Minimum 7-day APY (%) to consider (higher for aggressive)
min_apy_30d: 8.0          # Minimum 30-day APY (%) to consider
max_risk_score: 0.8      # Higher risk tolerance (0-1)
exclude_risk_flags:      # Risk flags that exclude a neuron (fewer exclusions)
  - very_low_validator_count

# Safety
max_total_stake_ratio: 0.9  # Can stake up to 90% of balance
require_confirmation: false  # Auto-execute (use with caution!)
