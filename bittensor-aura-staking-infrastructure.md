# 🚀 Project AURA

**Autonomous Unified Reward Allocator for Bittensor (TAO)**  
*Non-Custodial • Automated • Yield-Aware Staking Infrastructure*

---

## 📋 Overview

**AURA** is a non-custodial automation layer that continuously optimizes risk-adjusted TAO staking yield across Bittensor validators and subnets. The system monitors validator performance, detects underperforming delegations, and automatically rebalances stake allocations—all without taking custody of user funds.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Traditional TAO staking presents several critical challenges that result in suboptimal yield and capital inefficiency:

- 🔴 **Silent Failures**: Validator rewards can halt without notice, leaving stakers unaware of performance degradation
- 📉 **Ranking Dependencies**: Falling out of top emission ranks significantly impacts yield, but changes are often detected too late
- ⏰ **Delayed Detection**: Most stakers notice performance issues days or weeks after they occur
- 🔀 **Cross-Subnet Complexity**: Opportunities across multiple subnets are frequently ignored due to user experience complexity

**Impact**: These issues lead to idle capital, lost compounding opportunities, and weaker network decentralization.

## ✨ Solution Architecture

### ⚙️ Core Capabilities

AURA addresses these challenges through an intelligent automation framework:

- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous validator health monitoring with performance metrics tracking
- 🔄 **Automated Rebalancing**: Automatic redelegation when yield drops below configured thresholds
- 🛡️ **Yield Continuity**: Backup validator strategies ensure uninterrupted staking rewards
- 🌐 **Cross-Subnet Optimization**: Intelligent allocation across multiple subnets (SN-0, SN-2, and others)

### 🎯 Strategy Layer

The platform includes a sophisticated strategy engine that enables:

- ⚖️ **Risk Management**: Take-profit and stop-loss rules for automated position management
- 🔍 **Opportunity Detection**: Identification of emerging high-APY subnets and validators
- 📈 **Risk-Weighted Allocation**: Dynamic allocation based on subnet volatility and historical performance
